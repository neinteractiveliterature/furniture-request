        Please Note:
    | Most furniture requests will be merged into a single request per room that meets the needs of all larps in that room for the entire weekend.  We can not provide fully invidual setups for each event.  You may end up with more funiture that you need for your game, if so, please fold it against a wall as best you can.  Before Intercon, we will let you know what furniture will be in each room.
